  <h2>Culture & Traditon</h2>
  <p>
    The culture of Haiti has its roots in West Africa, and to this day many of its inhabitants feel more aligned to Africa than they do to the Caribbean or Americas. In fact, in 2012 Haiti announced its intention to join the African Union (a political entity representing the continent). Since Haiti was a former French colony, elements are still evident in culture, particularly in music and the language. A variant called “Creole” is widely spoken, but French is still the official language of Haiti, rivaled only by Canada as the most populous French-speaking nation in the Americas.

    Haiti adopted Roman Catholicism from its former French colonizers, although more famously the practice of Voodoo is observed. Voodoo has its roots in West Africa, but encompasses aspects of many religions, and is combined with traditional folklore and tales that have been passed down through the generations. The infamous Voodoo dolls are not a part of Haitian Voodoo, although the country’s Duvalier dictators used other fearful elements to oppress the nation during their tyrannical rule. West African culture has also influenced Haitian art work and jewelry. The Panthéon National Museum in Port-au-Prince houses artifacts and historic documents telling the tale of Haitian history from the Spanish conquest in 1492 through present day.
