  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    Christopher Columbus first landed at Mole Saint-Nicholas in 1492. Three weeks later, his ship continued to the site of the present day Cap-Haitien. Before that, the island of Hispaniola, which Haiti forms one-third of, was populated by native Taino Indians. They attempted to resist foreign occupation, as evidenced by the battle led by Queen Anacaona (who is now considered as one of Haiti’s founders), but ultimately lost. The Spanish wanted to island for its gold, but later the French colonists introduced sugar and tobacco plantations as export crops.

   The location of the island made it a haven for pirates, who would use the country as a base to loot passing ships traveling through the Caribbean en route to Europe. Many sought out Tortuga, a notion which has gone down in literary and romantic history. By the 17th century, French buccaneers had begun to settle in Hispaniola, causing conflict between France and Spain. By 1697, the island had been divided in two, and Haiti was ceded to France. They brought over slaves to work on the plantations and continued to rule for another 107 years.

   Inspired by the French Revolution of 1789, the slaves rose up and demanded to be freed. After a 10-year rebellion, the country finally gained independence in 1804. It was hailed a republic and was the first country to be governed by people of African descent in the world. The ensuing years of the 19th century saw a power struggle, and by 1915, the US military took Haiti in an attempt to restore political stability. Their presence lasted until 1934. By 1957 after some turmoil, the first of the Duvaliers took office, which unfortunately led to a dark period in Haiti’s past.

   Francois Duvalier had formerly been the Minister of Health, a position which earned him his nickname, Papa Doc. Initially he was popular among the Haitians, but his use of state-terrorist tactics to control the population turned him into an evil dictator until his death in 1971. Following Papa Doc was his son, Jean-Claude Duvalier, nicknamed Bebe Doc, who led the country until he was ousted in 1986. Both the Duvaliers used elements of voodoo to instill fear and oppression in the people, and were despised as leaders.

   A coup-d’état, elections and further coups followed until 1994 when democracy was restored with the help of the US administration. The army was disbanded and even today Haiti lacks an official military. The 2010 earthquake has not helped efforts to maintain stability and it was one of the most destructive ever recorded, leaving 316,000 people dead and 1.6 million homeless. This tragedy dealt a big blow to the already poverty stricken country, although international support to rebuild Haiti has been steady and successful.
